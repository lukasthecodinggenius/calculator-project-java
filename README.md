This netbeans project can perform all simple and basic functions for a calculator. The numbers are assigned to a button and are set with their values to be used on a text field. The numbers also have a if-else statement in its source code so that when a new number or sign is added, it would append the value to the text field. The calculator can utlize addition, subtraction, multiplaction, division, percent of, and square root, which work for multiple digits. When making the code for these signs, you create a button to intilize it and you assign it a String name. All operators are done this way. The equal sign uses a else-if statement to detect which operator is being used by checking the string value for it, then it performs the action of that specific sign owith the values. This calculators last feature is that it has memory functions. M+, MR, and MC. M+ saves the output, MR recalls the output, and MC clears it."
